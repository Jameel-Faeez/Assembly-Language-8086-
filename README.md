Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are widely used for secure banking transactions. In real-world scenarios, they rely on microcontrollers or processors to manage authentication and transaction processes. This project aims to simulate the basic authentication process of an ATM system using Assembly Language for the Intel 8086 processor.
The project is designed to operate in a text-based environment and focuses on implementing essential login features:

Requesting user ID

Requesting password

Verifying credentials against stored values

Displaying the access result
